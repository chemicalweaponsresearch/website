##### Hexachloroethane 

<br> 

In response to the US Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) repeated use of [Hexachloroethane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexachloroethane) (HC) munitions smoke grenades as weapons against protesters in Portland, we have begun studying the impacts of HC and the [Zinc Chloride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc_chloride) gas it creates on human and environmental health.

{{< figure src="3hcs.JPG" alt="Three canisters of HC stand in the foreground of the image, the background yields three other canisters of various chemical agents. The HC canisters are cylindrical with riveted tops resembling a paint can lid. Their markings have burned away with the heat of their ignition. Metal along the top has melted, peeled and been blown outwards. Their rough rounded edges border holes into the center of the canister. Chemical reactions have changed the color of the metal to dark grey, rust brown, and a navy blue. The canisters are dented from impact and appear to have lost any smoothness they may have once possessed." caption="Three Used HC Grenades - JL Simonis 2020" width="50%">}}
