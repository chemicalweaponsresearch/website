<h1>Defense Technology: A Corporate History</h1>
<p><small> <em>Dr. Juniper L. Simonis (they/them/theirs)</em></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><a href="https://www.defense-technology.com/">Defense Technology</a> is the predominate manufacturer of <a href="/munitions_library">chemical munitions we have recovered in Portland since May 2020</a> and their weapons are used by law enforcement agencies around the world.</p>
<p>Over the course of my work studying the environmental and human impacts of Defense Technology’s weapons, I became interested in understanding what this company was all about, where they came from, and who was profiting off of it.
I started digging into their corporate structure and history, which is extensive and old, with tendrils reaching into Big Names in the weapons industry like the American classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_%26_Wesson">Smith and Wesson</a> and the British multinational <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAE_Systems">BAE</a>.</p>
<p>BAE itself is the product of a conglomeration of British aircraft (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marconi_Company">The Marconi Company</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avro">A.V. Roe and Company</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland">de Havilland</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawker_Siddeley">Hawker Siddley</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Aircraft_Corporation">British Aircraft Corporation</a>) and boat (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarine">Supermarine</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarrow_Shipbuilders">Yarrow Shipbuilders</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfield_Shipbuilding_and_Engineering_Company">Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickers_Shipbuilding_and_Engineering">Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering</a>) manufacturers.</p>
