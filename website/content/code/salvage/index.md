[`salvage`](https://github.com/dapperstats.com/salvage) provides tools for smooth interactions with the [California Delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento%E2%80%93San_Joaquin_River_Delta) [fish salvage monitoring database](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Salvage-Monitoring). 

Each day, the [`/data` directory](https://github.com/dapperstats/salvage/blob/master/data) is populated with `.csv`s from an up-to-date "current" (1993 - Present) salvage database file (`Salvage_data_FTP.accdb`).
The `.csv` files are then used to update the [data presentation website (salvage.fish)](https://salvage.fish).
