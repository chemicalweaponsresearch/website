  alt_text: Small dimpled spheres that resemble golf balls are pictured on the ground. Their paint colors vary, but the ones pictured are red and a gradient of white to yellow to Orange to pink and red. These dimples function to make the spheres noticeably more aerodynamic when propelled. They're made of a smooth plastic like substance that appears hard to the touch. Much like a smaller golf ball.
