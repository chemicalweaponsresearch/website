  alt_text: fn303 rounds are pictured, some are intact and some just pieces of broken plastic casings, but horrible bismuth beads are seen up front in the intact balls. They look a lot like pepper balls, round and plastic, two halves snapped together like sinister Easter Eggs, but the have stabilizers on the bottom to direct their impact. Rough plastic with channels for aerodynamic performance.
