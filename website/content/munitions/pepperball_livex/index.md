  alt_text: five half-black half-red pepper balls, three broken open two intact, surrounding a green marking pepper ball are pictured on the ground. They're plastic balls, round and smooth, made up of two parts that snap together like an Easter Egg. Inside the intact ones we can just barely see compacted powder. Outside the broken ones, they are covered in a white dust.
