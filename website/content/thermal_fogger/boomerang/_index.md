As to be expected, following [Foucaultâ€™s Boomerang](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opensecurity/foucaults-boomerang-new-military-urbanism/), the repressive technique (thermal fogging) developed by a country (USA) to control colonial territories (Vietnam) will be used by the same country (USA) on its own people (Graham 2013).

Indeed, it took only three years from initial deployment in Vietnam to first application in the United States to gas racial justice and anti-war protesters.

The return of the boomerang was aided significantly by the militarization of US police forces, the transition of veterans to law enforcement occupations upon returning home, and substantial propaganda in a variety of specialized and generalized outlets.
