### [Analyzing Chemical Weapons Residue](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-us-study-chemical-weapon-impact-in-portland)

[DAPPER Stats](https://www.dapperstats.com) is working with local university researchers and [Specialty Analytical](https://www.specialtyanalytical.com/) to understand the impact of chemical weapons residues in Portland OR's parks, schools, houses, and rivers. 
A key component of this work is the identifying and measuring of compounds in the samples, which requires expensive equipment and reagents as well as staff with specialized skills. 
[This campaign](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-us-study-chemical-weapon-impact-in-portland) is targeted at funding the processing of samples collected in an elementary school playground, where Department of Homeland Security agents deployed toxic chemical weapons.

Prior to this campaign, all of the chemical weapons research had been funded completely through [DAPPER Stats](https://www.dapperstats.com)' internal funds, and we currently have no other funding for this research.
