Formed during the Black Lives Matter protests in Portland, Oregon, we are a collection of researchers, science communicators, and advocates focused on understanding the impact of chemical weapons on humans and the environment. 
Our projects are diverse, but we are brought together by an urgent need to understand what chemicals are being used by military and law enforcement and how they are affecting all of us.
