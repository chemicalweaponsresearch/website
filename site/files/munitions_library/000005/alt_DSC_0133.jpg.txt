"A long cylinder is pictured on the ground with smooth concrete beneath it. The cylinder is roughly 5 inches long and made of a shiny silver metal, such as aluminum or steel. There is a lip at the bottom like one would find on a shotgun shell. Stamped on the metal are the words `Defence Technology, Spede-Heat, Saf Smoke, 40 millimeter long range - 150 yard, 40 millimeter single projectile.` The lettering on the shell has been damaged and is largely illegible."
