<img src="images/3hcs.jpg" alt="Three canisters of HC stand in the foreground of the image, the background yields three other canisters of various chemical agents. The HC canisters are cylindrical with riveted tops resembling a paint can lid. Their markings have burned away with the heat of their ignition. Metal along the top has melted, peeled and been blown outwards. Their rough rounded edges border holes into the center of the canister. Chemical reactions have changed the color of the metal to dark grey, rust brown, and a navy blue. The canisters are dented from impact and appear to have lost any smoothness they may have once possessed." width="400" class="center">
