Formed in 2020 during the Black Lives Matter protests, we are a collection of research and outreach teams around Portland, Oregon focused on understanding the impact of chemical weapons used by law enforcement on humans and the environment. 
Our projects are diverse, but we are brought together by an urgent need to understand what chemicals are being used and how they are affecting all of us.
