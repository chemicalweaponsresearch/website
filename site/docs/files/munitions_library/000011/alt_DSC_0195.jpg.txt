"A hand is pictured holding a old aluminum, silver canister, with orange writing that says 'TD flameless tri-chamber oc Defense Technology' A mechanism at the top made of black plastic appears to be some kind of grenade trigger. Like an old bug bomb cannister. It's lipped at the top of the aluminum cannister, where the lid is crimped over the canister, shaped like a cylinder. The metal is worn and scraped and dented."
