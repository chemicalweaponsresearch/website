"An old, small, silver grenade canister is pictured with yellow writing that says `TD Pocket Tactical SAF Smoke`, the aluminum canister is nearly 5 inches long but only about an inch and a half in diameter. The trigger mechanism is black plastic, with a long plastic compression arm. The security ring is missing from the smoke grenade, because it's been used."
