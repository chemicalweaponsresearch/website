"Two old aluminum smoke grenade canisters are pictured with green writing that says `CM Green Smoke Defense Technology`. Both still retain their black plastic trigger mechanism covers, but neither have their fuse rings. Both have been used. The 6 inch tall, nearly two and a half inch wide aluminum canister has a crimped smooth lid at the top, securing the fuse plug in place."
